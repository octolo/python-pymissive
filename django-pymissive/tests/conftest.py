"""Pytest configuration shared by all django-pymissive tests.

We don't ship Django migrations for the lib's own apps (the project
that integrates django-pymissive owns its migrations). Tests run
against an in-memory SQLite DB and use ``--create-db`` semantics, so
we let pytest-django build the schema directly from the models via
``django.test.utils.setup_test_environment`` + ``create_all`` (the
default behaviour when ``MIGRATION_MODULES`` makes migrations a no-op
for the apps under test).
